# BinaryTools
Binaries recopiled and precompiled from Github, XDA and more
These binaries are free to use and distribute. Some of them can be used on adb shell and terminal emulator and other ones are only for unpack/work with .img of android and linux (haven't tried)
To use the binaries in adb shell or an terminal emulator you have to push them to /system/bin or /sys/bin (depends of the phone) and chmod 777 them (as root) and now you can use them !!
